# Loan Eligibility Predictor 🏦

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts whether a loan applicant is eligible for a loan or not based on various input features. Built using Python and common data science libraries, this model can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions quickly.

## 📘 Project Overview

The goal of this notebook is to:

* Load and preprocess a loan dataset.
* Analyze and visualize the data.
* Train and evaluate a machine learning model (Logistic Regression).
* Predict loan eligibility for new applicants.

## 🔍 Features

* Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Model training using Logistic Regression.
* Performance evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix.
* Predictive functionality to test model with user-defined input.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

* **Gender**
* **Married**
* **Dependents**
* **Education**
* **Self\_Employed**
* **ApplicantIncome**
* **CoapplicantIncome**
* **LoanAmount**
* **Loan\_Amount\_Term**
* **Credit\_History**
* **Property\_Area**
* **Loan\_Status** (Target)

> 📌 Note: The dataset used is assumed to be cleaned and prepared for demonstration purposes.

## 🧪 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-eligibility-predictor.git
   cd loan-eligibility-predictor
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Loan\ Eligibility.ipynb
   ```

4. Run all cells to see results and try the prediction yourself!

## 📊 Model Performance

* **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
* **Accuracy**: \~ (update this with your actual score if available)
* **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix and accuracy score used to assess performance.

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add more models for comparison (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest).
* Build a web app with Flask or Streamlit for user-friendly predictions.
* Implement more robust feature engineering.
